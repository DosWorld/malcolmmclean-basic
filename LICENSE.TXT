License

You can do virtually anything you like with this code, including incorporating
it into your own programs, or modifying as the basis for a scripting language
of your own. It would be nice to be acknowledged but I don't insist on it - you
can pretend that you created the program on your own if it makes your boss
happy.

The only thing you can't do is restrict my rights in the program in any way.
So any derivative works or enhancements I can use as I see fit.
